# General Project Information (RotatingartLauncher)

Load this file before planning or modifying code in this repository.

## Project Identity

- Type: Android launcher for .NET/FNA-style games.
- Primary module: `:app`.
- Root name: `Rotating-art-Launcher`.
- Main package namespace: `com.app.ralaunch`.

## Tech and Build Stack

- Android app module with Kotlin + Compose + CMake native integration.
- DI framework: Koin.
- Coroutines + Flow for async/state.
- Native runtime integrations under `app/src/main/cpp`.
- Patch system with C# patch projects under `patches`.

## Build Constraints and Runtime Assumptions

- ABI split: `arm64-v8a` only.
- Java/Kotlin target: JVM 21.
- `app` compile SDK 36, target SDK 35, min SDK 28.
- `.NET` and runtime libraries are partly bundled and partly extracted/loaded at runtime.
- APK packaging excludes several large runtime `.so` files and expects runtime extraction/loading logic to provide them.

## Startup and Runtime Flow

1. Launcher activity from manifest: `.feature.init.ui.InitializationActivity`.
2. App process bootstrap in `RaLaunchApp`:
   - density adapter
   - Koin startup
   - theme setup
   - crash capture init
   - patch extraction/install background work
3. Initialization flow extracts required runtime/game components.
4. Main Compose UI hosted by `.feature.main.MainActivityCompose`.
5. Game execution hosted by `.feature.game.legacy.GameActivity` in `:game` process.

## Process Model

- Main app process: launcher UI and most feature logic.
- `:game` process: SDL game runtime + game-specific services.
- `:launcher` process: `ProcessLauncherService` for background assembly launch.
- VPN multiplayer service: `EasyTierVpnService` runs in `:game` process and uses foreground service + TUN.

## Module Responsibilities

- `app`:
  Android app shell, repositories, navigation, feature UIs, platform services, runtime launchers, and native bridge usage.
- `patches`:
  Patch projects and manifests used by patch installation/activation.

## Directory Landmarks

- `app/src/main/java/com/app/ralaunch/core`:
  infrastructure and platform integration, including repositories, DI, navigation, theme, and runtime services.
- `app/src/main/java/com/app/ralaunch/feature`:
  feature verticals (`init`, `main`, `game`, `controls`, `gog`, `installer`, `patch`, `settings`, `filebrowser`, `announcement`, `crash`, `sponsor`).
- Common subpackage convention inside `core` and `feature` trees:
  - `.../ui` for Compose screens, wrappers, and UI helpers
  - `.../vm` for ViewModels and state coordinators
  - `.../model` for feature-owned models, DTOs, and state/data shapes
  - `.../contract` for contracts and interfaces
  - `.../service` for concrete services, managers, and repository implementations
- `app/src/main/cpp/main`, `app/src/main/cpp/dotnethost`:
  first-party native runtime bridges.
- `app/src/main/cpp/SDL`, `FNA3D`, `gl4es`, `FAudio`:
  large vendored native source trees.
- `app/src/main/assets`:
  bundled control defaults and patch/runtime support assets.

## Dependency Injection Map

- App bootstrap DI:
  `app/src/main/java/com/app/ralaunch/core/di/KoinInitializer.kt`.
- App Android module registrations:
  `app/src/main/java/com/app/ralaunch/core/di/AppModule.kt`.
- Contracts:
  `app/src/main/java/com/app/ralaunch/core/di/contract`.
- Implementations:
  `app/src/main/java/com/app/ralaunch/core/di/service`.

## High-Coupling Areas

- `feature/main` orchestration and wrappers.
- `core/platform/runtime` launch/runtime environment.
- `feature/game` + SDL integration.
- `feature/controls` editor/render/input paths.
- `feature/patch` + `patches` synchronization.
- repository contracts and implementations under `core/di`.

## Pre-Modification Read Order

1. Confirm module and package boundaries with:
   `scripts/project_map.sh .`
2. Load architecture notes:
   `references/rotatingart-architecture.md`
3. For any specific target folder, load:
   `../analyze-subcomponents/references/subcomponent-implementation-details.md`
4. Run component profiling:
   `../analyze-subcomponents/scripts/component_profile.sh <target> .`
