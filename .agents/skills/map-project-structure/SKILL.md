name: map-project-structure
description: Map overall repository architecture, package boundaries, build wiring, and runtime entry points for this Android launcher project. Use when asked to understand the codebase quickly, onboard to the project, produce architecture summaries, locate where changes belong, or explain how app code, native C++ code, and external assets fit together.

# Map Project Structure

## Quick Start

1. Run `scripts/project_map.sh [repo-root]` to generate a current structure snapshot.
2. Read `references/general-project-information.md` for direct project context.
3. Read `references/rotatingart-architecture.md` for curated architecture notes.
4. Verify findings against `settings.gradle`, `app/build.gradle`, and `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

## Mandatory Pre-Modification Context

Before proposing edits in any subcomponent:

1. Confirm target package boundary and top-level architecture with `scripts/project_map.sh`.
2. Load `references/general-project-information.md`.
3. If the target is a specific feature/package, also load:
   - `../analyze-subcomponents/references/subcomponent-implementation-details.md`
   - `../analyze-subcomponents/references/component-analysis-checklist.md`
4. State the chosen edit entry point and expected blast radius.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the Gradle shape from `settings.gradle` includes and module build files.
2. Identify runtime entry points from manifest components and application bootstrap files.
3. Map package topology:
   - `app/src/main/java/com/app/ralaunch/core` for app-wide infrastructure, repositories, navigation, theme, and platform/runtime code.
   - `app/src/main/java/com/app/ralaunch/feature` for feature-level product code.
   - `patches` and `app/src/main/assets` for bundled patch/runtime support data.
4. Separate first-party code from vendored code:
   - Treat large trees under `app/src/main/cpp` (SDL, FNA3D, gl4es, FAudio) as external unless the task explicitly targets native internals.
5. Deliver a concise map tailored to the current request, not a full tree dump.

## Output Contract

- Return a concise architecture map with concrete paths and one-line responsibilities.
- Highlight one recommended edit entry point for the user task.
- State uncertainty explicitly when docs and on-disk structure differ.
